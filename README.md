# Copy of AutoGluon with adaptions to the ENAS module
Copy of the [original AutoGluon repository](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon). This repository slightly modifies the original repository by fixing a bug and adapting the ENAS module. It is mainly used as a submodule in [this](https://github.com/LukasBudach/LightNAS) respository.
